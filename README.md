# Gabriel Cabrera's Github Repository
Hi everyone! This is a compilation of activities in my CPE 311 course.

## Introduction
Hello everyone! I'm Gabriel Cabrera, a 3rd year student in Tedchnological Insitute of the Philippines, I'm 25 years old and currently live in Quezon City. My hobbies include watching anime, reading manga, and collecting anime figurines. I also like playing playing video games and learning video game development on my free time. I can code in various programming languages like C++ and Python and have experience in frontend development like HTML, CSS, and little bit of Java. Hopefully, I can learn things in this course and the elective itself that can help me in my future careers and projects.
